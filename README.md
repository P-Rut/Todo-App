# Todo App

We've all been there...
While learning and aspiring to be a front-end developer, 
I also decided to practise simple backend topics to have a basic knowledge about it.
This is how this simple todo application with backend was created to practice a little vanilla js,css and node.js

### Usage 
To run it since it's made with mongo you need to and env file with your MONGO_URI

#### .env file content â†“
#### NODE_ENV=development
#### PORT=7777
#### MONGO_URI = mongodb+srv://YourURI
